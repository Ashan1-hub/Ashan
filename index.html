<p>
I am an applicant with lots of dynamic qualities to offer. I have long searched for a position whereby
windows of opportunity may be opened to me.
Having a fairly diverse background I would like to present my resume to you. It can be seen on perusing
my resume that I have gained many valuable cross-functional skills, and I am willing to consider a range of
job prospects.
I am a hard worker and I am able to communicate and work with a diverse range of people from casual
staff to Regional Management. I am able to cope without supervision and also work under pressure. I
thrive on a challenge.
My previous and current experience has been in the field of construction and aluminium.
I am in possession of a certificate of construction management from the University of Capetown since
2021. I am also currently studying at Hyperion development towards a software engineer certificate and I
am in the process of completing it.
